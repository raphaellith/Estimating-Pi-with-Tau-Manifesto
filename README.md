# Estimating-Pi-with-Tau-Manifesto

Approximates the value of pi by analysing the letter frequencies of the Tau Manifesto. See my write-up [here](https://raphaellith.github.io/The-Dumping-Ground/2025/03/14/Zipfs-Law-On-Tau-Manifesto/).

Includes code by scraping the manifesto's official website, performing the estimation process and rendering related graphs.
